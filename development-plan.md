# Development Plan

## Sprint 1 Summary
- User authentication module implemented
- Backend JWT-based authentication working
- Frontend login/register pages functional

## Sprint 2: Property Management Module ✅

**Objectives Completed:**
1. Created `PropertyModel` in `backend/models/property_model.py` using Pydantic v2 structure (string IDs for MongoDB compatibility)
2. Implemented CRUD endpoints in `backend/routers/property_router.py` with JWT authentication
3. Integrated MongoDB operations, following patterns consistent with existing models
4. Built front-end Property Management page (`frontend/src/app/properties/page.tsx`) with create, list, and delete UX
5. Connected frontend with backend through JWT-secured API calls
6. Verified end-to-end CRUD operations post authentication

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ View properties list functioning
- ✅ Create property adds to database
- ✅ Delete property removes correctly
- ✅ MongoDB integration stable
- ✅ Pydantic schema validation errors resolved

**Next Steps (Sprint 3 Preview):**
- Add property analytics (cashflow metrics)
- Implement property edit (PATCH endpoint in UI)
- Integrate charts for rental income vs expenses

**Status:** ✅ Sprint 2 complete and verified locally.
